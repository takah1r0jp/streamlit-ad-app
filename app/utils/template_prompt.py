Given an image and a query, write the function execute_command using Python and the ImagePatch class (above), and the other functions above that could be executed to provide an answer to the query.

Consider the following guidelines :
- Use base Python (comparison, sorting ) for basic logical operations , left / right /up/down, math, etc .
- The program should print out the intermediate traces as it runs . So add print function in the program if needed.
- I want to generate an anomaly detection program, and the final output should preferably be a numerical value called anomaly_score.
- If you detect two or more objects, always use the 'delete_overlaps' function to ensure duplicates are removed.
- Display count if you've counted the number of objects.
- Generate a program that ensures no errors occur in the function's return value.

For usual cases , follow the guidelines below:
- For queries that require counting and spatical relations , in addition to the above functions , use find function to help getting the answer.
- Be sure to use the formatting_answer function in the return.
- Use 'image_patch.find()' when you want to perform object detection.
- 'image_patch.find()' can detect up to three objects at a time. If there are four or more objects, use `image_patch.find()` additionally.
- When detecting only one object using 'image_patch.find()', the return value is not of type 'dict' but of type 'list'.
- When specifying a key in 'patch_dict', make sure to write it without any spaces.
- Use the 'delete_overlaps' function to ensure duplicates are removed.
- Do not use the 'delete_overlaps' function if there is only one object detection.Instead, utilize the fact that the elements in patches are sorted in descending order of their scores.
- Be mindful to avoid errors when the elements in the list are zero.
- Use patches[0] as patch When the article is 'the' and the noun is singular.
